    <h2>Coffe is my world</h2><br>
    <p id="budy">
        If you can't imagine life without coffee, you're not alone: Ree Drummond starts every day with a cup. (She loves it so much that she just launched The Pioneer Woman coffee line!) There are so many popular types of coffee to choose from,
         but for Ree, cold brew is the way to go. She mastered the art of making perfect cold-brewed iced coffee at home years ago, and these days she gets growlers of the stuff from her Pawhuska, OK, shop and restaurant The Mercantile, 
         so she can have a tall glass every morning. "To say I couldn't live without it is an understatement," she says. Her obsession is on full display at The Merc's café, which serves a bunch of different types of coffee drinks: cold brew, of course, as well as espresso-based drinks like cortados, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and more.

Even for avid coffee drinkers, the menu at The Merc and other cafés can be tricky to navigate. You could brew drip coffee for yourself every day and still not know what distinguishes coffee from espresso, or how to tell a latte from a cappuccino. Keep reading for an easy guide to different types of coffee, starting with the most common coffee bean varieties. You might be inspired to switch up your café order or even whip up some fancy drinks at home!

    <h2>Types of Hot Coffee Drinks</h2>
    <h3>1)-Black coffe</h3>
    <div id="black-cofe">
        <img src="black cofe.jpg" width="40%" height="200px"/>
        
        <p class="black"> <br>frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee<br>
             beans that are brewed hot. <br>
            It's served without added sugar, milk, or flavorings.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>2)-Espresso</h3>
    <div id="cofe">
     <p class="espreso">
        Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee,<br>
        but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves,<br>
        but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher<br>
        grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker,<br>
         more concentrated liquid with a bolder flavor. <br>
        A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. <br>
        It's also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.<br>
     </p>
        
        <img src="espresso.jpg" width="40%" height="200px"/>
    </div>
    <h3>3)-Latte</h3>
    <div id="late">
        <img src="Latte.jpg" width="40%" height="200px"/>
        
        <p class="cofe_late"> 
        This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, <br>
        topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up<br>
        with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with<br> 
        flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk.<br> 
        Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!<br>

    <h2>Types of Cold Coffee Drinks</h2>
    <h3>1)-Cold Brew</h3>
    <div id="hot">
        <img src="hot.jpg" width="40%" height="200px"/>
        
        <p class="coffehot"> 
        Cold brew is one of the biggest coffee trends of the last decade,<br>
        and for good reason: It's made by slowly steeping coffee grounds<br>
        over cool or room-temperature water, <br>
        so it tastes smoother and less bitter than regular iced coffee,<br>
        which is brewed hot.<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>2)-Nitro Cold Brew</h3>
    <div id="nitro">
        
        
        <p class="coffe-nitro"> 
     Cutting-edge coffee roasters developed this newer type of cold brew using <br>
     techniques from the beer industry:<br>
     It's infused with nitrogen bubbles, so it has a frothy, beer-like texture.<br>
      Trendy coffee houses dispense nitro cold brew from taps,<br>
     and you can buy it by the can from brands like RISE Brewing Co. and Starbucks.<br>
